# Connect_5_Coding_Challenge

### Description 
The Game is a Connect 5. A server for a multiple 2-player game. 
It listen for 2 clients to connects and creates a thread for each Player 1 and 2. 
The client and server communicate through messages back and forth to each other. 
Messages correspond to the Game protocol.
